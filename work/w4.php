                <p class="description">I created a TTY Football Game where the user can play football through text with a computerized oponent. The user chooses a name for their team, the home team, and the opposing team. From there, the game allows the user the call the coin toss: heads or tails. After the coin toss, the game begins and the users team either kicks or receives. Throughout the game, the offensive team can choose to run the ball, make a pass, punt the ball or attempt a field goal. The defensive team can choose to either defend the run or play a run defense, defend the play or play pass defense, blitz or set up for a kick return. The game ends when the time expires in the fourth quarter. The team with the most points at the end of the game is the winner
                <br><br>
                I used Object Oriented principles using Java to create this TTY Football Game. The computerized oponent creates plays using a randomized algorithm. </p>
