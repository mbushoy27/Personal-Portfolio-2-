                <p class="description">During Summer 2018, I interned at Quicken Loans as a Web Developer Intern. I worked on an internal web development team of 6 engineers who primarily support internal training teams, mortgage banking teams, and human resource teams. While on this team, I leveraged WordPress as the CMS and MySQL for database connections. The development stack consisted of PHP, JavaScript, HTML, Sass and Foundation as a front-end framework.
                <br><br>
                For one project in particular, I was the lead engineer. I built a website which helped mortgage bankers easily find information when speaking to clients. I handled both the design and development stages of this product. Once in development, I built the website from the ground up. Ultimately, the final product utilized an advanced search feature, while also allows mortgage bankers to sift through the information manually based on categories and keywords. This website is now in production and utilized by mortgage bankers at Quicken Loans.
                <br><br>
                I also worked on an internally built social engagement plugin that allows for users to like, favorite, comment on or share content. This engagement plugin is widely used throughout multiple training applications within Quicken Loans.
                <br><br>
                While at Quicken Loans, I worked in an agile environment, which followed typical daily ceremonies such as a daily stand up (scrum) meeting, sprint planning, retro and refinements. I also become trained in the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe). The projects listed above, among others, further solidified my understanding of PHP, JavaScript, HTML and Sass. I also gained valuable experiences which guided me through lessons of independence, collaboration and problem solving.
